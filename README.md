# Rishit Yogesh Bafna — Portfolio

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Design decisions
- IDE-inspired layout with a sidebar explorer, tab strip, and status-bar footer.
- Typography-first hierarchy using IBM Plex Sans + Mono for dense, readable scans.
- Panels and borders emphasize structure without visual noise.
- Content is strictly bullet-driven to keep every page skim-friendly.

## Notes
- Place the resume PDF at `public/resume.pdf`.
